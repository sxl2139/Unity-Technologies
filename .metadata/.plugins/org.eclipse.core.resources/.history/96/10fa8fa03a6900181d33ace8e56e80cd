Question: Suppose that the data was extremely large, and did not fit in memory. What problems would
this cause? How could these problems be solved?

What problems would this cause?
1.Results in out of memory exception. This further causes negative impact on the application.

How could these problems be solved?
This problem can be solved by storing the data in the external data storage. 
When the external data storage also becomes full we can split the data into many data storage. 
We can divide the data into certain specific paramters like 
	a. Order of Appearance - divide data in order of appearance.
	 When the memory gets full one data storage, it is then carried to next data storage.
	b. Hash Value - As data comes in, the hash of the data is found. 
	It is then stored in the data storage which is decided using the formula hash % number of machines.
	c. Use Look Up Table - Data is arbitrarily broken up and a lookup table is implemented to
	identify which machine holds a piece of data.Later, get index from look up table to decide which data 
	storage should be used to store and retrieve data.
